            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            So, I lied. Hip-hop was *not* this class's most challenging lesson. Today's lesson is. Experimental music. But, just as with hip-hop, I'm going to have to ask you to keep an open mindâ€”a REALLY open mind.  We are going to be dealing with sound itself on its *own* terms.
            <br><br>
            We're going to slip the bounds of Western 12 tone equal temperament. Heck, we're going to escape *all* musical systems. We're going to listen to people with zero musical skill bringing their full authentic selves to us through their own musical expression. We're going to let a roll of the dice pick notes on a staff. We're going to let pure randomness fuzz the sinewaves that undulate through the air. And, at the last, we will venture into pure *noise*.
            <br><br>
            The music in this lesson will rarely be "enjoyable" in the traditional sense. At least at first. This class is about *pure experience.* About communing with sound and your own sense of hearing in ways you never have before, in ways you could never have conceived of, in ways no person could have.
            <br><br>
            This is music *beyond* the edge.
            <br><br>
            There is no historical prologue to this lesson. As long as beings have knocked against a tree or a rock and thought, "Hunh, interesting," there has been experimental music. So, instead, we'll need to think conceptually and allow that to guide us. We are dealing with all sound here, anything percievable. The range of human hearing is roughly 20Hz to 20 kHzâ€”a rather wide world. So, where to begin?
            <br><br>
            First, let's think about experimental music in the sense of something carried out with the intention of observing the results, but without full control of what those results may be. In this way we will be examining the work of artists who were skilled musicians, but chose to break away from the expected, as well as artists who were not skilled musicians, but through their unawareness of what they were doing, could have had no preconception of the final product of their imagination. 
            <br><br>
            We'll also stretch this term into what might loosely be called the avant-gardeâ€”music that sits beyond classification. Music that was carefully composed (an intended result in sight), but the experience of which can hardly have been predicted. 
            <br><br>
            Ultimately,what we're really doing is examining music that is guided primarily by a spirit of "what if...?"  
            <br><br>
            What if I let an ancient chinese book guide my machinations? What if I place two speakers exactly this many feet apart and play exactly these opposing frequencies? What if my three daughtersâ€”who've never touched an instrumentâ€”form a band? What if I throw a lightbulb at a guitar? What if my great talent is love, and I want to express it through my least talent, music?
            <br><br>
            Make sure you don't check out. Focus, focus, focus on the sound. There will not always be meaningâ€”do not look for it. There is no more meaning to a John Cage piece than there is to the sharp jag turns of a cracked mirror. Sometimes it will be pure meaning. Daniel Johnston's songs, like, "Love Will Find You In The End" are pure, raw meaning. Some lack talent; some are brilliant, if strange; for some, there is no point in discussing "talent". All along the road there is charm, adventure, and fascination to be had.
            <br><br>
            So, what's the gameplan then? How to proceed through such chaotic waters?  First, we'll take a quick overview of the terms associated with this area of music. Then, we'll jump head first into the music itself. I must warn you before we begin: There's really no good way to categorize these artists. I've deemed itâ€”shall we sayâ€”<i>practical</i> to slot different artists into specific "genres".  But where does musique concrete begin and electronic end? What about experimental and avant-garde?

            <h1>Terms</h1>
            <h2>Aleatoric</h2>
            <p>Aleatoric music is a mid-ground between pure chance and pure composition. Parts of it are left to chance, though there are some limits to how things may unfold. </p>
            <p>We can find this type of music even in Mozart's time and the <i>Musikalisches WÃ¼rfelspiel</i>, or "musical dice game." There would be a sequence of measures of music, the order of which would be determined at the performance by the roll of dice.</p>
            <p>John Cage's works are a more modern example of this. famously, in some of his works, he would use the <i>I Ching</i> to determine a variety of features of his composition. But, still, there was always some limit. Perhaps the I Ching would determine the placement of a screw in the wires of a piano, but it would always be a piano used.</p>
            <p>There were also the graphical scores used by many experimental composers in teh mid-20th century. We'll see some examples of these later on, but to sum up the idea, traditional musical notation is done away with and some sort of drawing is meant to guide the player in their performance, rather than givign specific isntructions.</p>
            <p>Another interesting example is music in games. In this we find the performer unaware of their performance. As one moves through the world of a game, the music needs to adjust to player input and the condition of the gameplay. In some versions of Tetris, for example, as your stack of blocks gets closer to the danger zone, the speed of the music picks up. In adventure games, as you move from area to area, the music will change to express the nature of your new surroundings. All of this needs to feel like a single uninterrupted experience, yet it is controlled unconsciously all along by the player.</p>
            <h2>Avant-Garde</h2>
            <p>Ask different people and you'll get slightly different answers on what qualifies as "avant-garde". For the purposes of this lesson, I am calling any music that uses established forms and aims to be "enjoyable" (in the traditional sense), yet pushes past the boundaries of presently codified genres.</p>
            <h2>Circuit Bending</h2>
            <p></p>
            <!-- <h2>Fluxus</h2>
            <p>Fluxus was a movement, a moment, in art history. At least, sort of. Fluxus might be the hardest part of this list to pin down. While it was a semi-organized art movement that had a so-called beginning and end, we can find art that exists outside those bounds. Fluxus is about process as art. </p> -->
            <h2>Free Jazz</h2>
            <p>Free Jazz can be considered an umbrella term that encompases Free Jazz proper, Free Improvisation, and avant-garde Jazz. The music here began around the 60s and aims to break free of Jazz conventions. Destroy the meter; obliterate the tonic; flush the harmonies; chrush the chords. As more conventions are destroyed, so more yet must be destroyed. As new conventions arise, so much they too be brought asunder.</p>
            <h2>lowercase</h2>
            <p>I'll steal a quote from <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/rjq7pb/youneedtohearthis-lowercase-the-music-genre-that-should-be-a-typeface-but-is-made-out-of-paper" target="#">a Vice article on the topic</a>: "Lowercase... attempts to combat the overload of noise; focusing on the small details in life rather than huge crashing sounds. Lowercase music is a mix of ambient, field recording samples of the sounds we overlook in life, and sometimes pure silence."</p>
            <h2>Musique Concrete</h2>
            <p>Music that uses recorded, real-life sounds (i.e. not instruments) for the music. It began in the 40s with a Frenchman named Pierre Schaeffer. Over the many years of this genre's development, the main goal has been to create new sounds out of the old, to take those real-life sounds and manipulate the recordings to create something fresh and surprising.</p>
            <h2>Noise</h2>
            <p>Noise as a genre is exactly what it sounds like. It's a genre of music that aims to draw your attention to all the things we don't think to listen to. By bringing attention to noise, we recontextualize it as something desirable. Have you ever really sat back and listened to the all the little sounds that make up the big sounds from a backhoe at work? Have you ever thought to tap a box of tea, and listen? Have you ever seen a man shove a microphone all the way to the back of his mouth and scream as hard as he can for twenty minutes straight? Can you imagine what that experience would be? After five minutes? Ten? Nineteen?</p>
            <p>For sure, it's funny to think about. But after you've laughed, put aside the sense of absurdity and draw your attention to all the sounds, the noises. All that part of your daily life you give so little thought to. And, then, maybe laugh again. Sometimes it's pretty darn funny.</p>
            <p>Noise music really began in the early 20th century, pioneered by futurists like Luigi Russolo who wrote what is probably the first manifesto on teh topic, <i>L'Arte dei Rumori</i>, or The Art of Noises.</p>
            <p>The Industrial Revolution brought with it a whole vast new world of strang sounds, and the noise movement sought to comprehend the music of industry through a varity of means. </p>
            <p>For those of you interested in "strange" art, the most well-known noise artist maybe be John Cage. And you may be pelased to know that I've been playing his most famous work, 4'33" on a loop since the lesson started.</p>
            <p>For those less familiar with the more twisted nooks of the music world, the most famous artist in the arena of noise would probably be Lou Reed. He's more well known for his various work with The Velvet Underground, but his standalone album, <i>Metal Machien Music</i>, gained him almost equal notoriety in a different corner of the music world.</p>
            <h2>Onkyo-kei</h2>
            <p>A form of noise music that focuses on minimalism and paying close attention to the fine details in the texture of individual sounds.</p>
            <h2>Outsider Music</h2>
            <p>Outsider music is not a genre. It's a classification. And, perhaps, some would consider it an unfair classification. But, essentially, it's music from people who, for lack of a better way to put it, can't make music. At least, they can't seem to make music the way your average Top-40s listener would appreciate. These artists usually have little-to-no music training. They often suffer from disabilities. But what they all have is art. Even the worst of so-called outsider music has charm. And some of it is truely excellent, if unconventional. And much of itâ€”surprisingly, some of the "worst" of itâ€”has been massively influential to insiders.</p>
            <h2>Vocaloid</h2>
            <p>Vocaloid music is a strange one. And it may not even strictly fit into experimental music at all. But it felt so interesting and "out there" that I just had to include it. How to explain?</p>
            <p>So, basically, a company puts out a piece of software. This software allows youâ€”anyoneâ€”to create a song purely on the computer and have a cartoon character sing it. Different types of software will offer different characters with different voices and different capabilities. The songs created with the software can then be uploaded to the internet and enjoyed by all. Via internet voting, the songs that are enjoyed the most rise through the ranks. Eventually, they may even get featured at a live concert.</p>
            <p>That's right, these purely fictional creations have live performances. Usually a real band will be on stage along with a hologram of the cartoon performer. These characters can do things real singers never could, includign instant costume changes, flyign around the stage, and singing lyrics at impossible speeds. It's wild.</p>
            <h2>Zeuhl</h2>
            <p>Another one that may not strictly be experimental. But it <i>feels</i> like it is, so I'm including it.</p>
            <p>Prog Rock band Magma basically wanted to make a music for a future space opera. They invented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koba%C3%AFan" target="#">their own langauge, KobaÃ¯an,</a> and developed a musical form around it that, indeed, feels like a space opera transmitted back through time.</p>
            <p>After they created the mythological music, other bands picked up on the idea and ran with it!</p>

            <div class="artist">Gyorgy Ligeti </div>
            <div class="song">Artikulation</div>
            <div class="year">1958</div>
            <div class="details">Ligeti was a Hungarian composer who was instrumental in driving the development of the avant-garde in music in the mid-20th century. His work may feel familiar at timesâ€”while he never explicitly composed for film, a lot of his work has been absorbed into cinema by directors who were fans of his, such as Kubrick and Scorsese. <br><br> The work we're listening to here is one of his few electronic pieces. The piece was composed using a mix of chance and explicit composition. Ligeti explained: "First I chose types [of noise, or artificial phonemes] with various group-characteristics and various types of internal organization, as: grainy, friable, fibrous, slimy, sticky and compact materials. An investigation of the relative permeability of these characters indicated which could be mixed and which resisted mixture." He then created recordings of these sounds, cut them individually from the taped recording, and grouped them into bins according to their characteristics. He then reached into the bins at random, took out a slice of recording, and taped it together. <br><br>The graphical score we'll be viewing along with the music was created after the fact by a graphic designer with Ligeti's approval. It is designed to guide the listener towards a "unique and appealing aesthetic."</div>
