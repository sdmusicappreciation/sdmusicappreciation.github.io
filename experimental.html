            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            So, I lied. Hip-hop was <i>not</i> this class's most challenging lesson. Today's lesson is. Experimental music. But, just as with hip-hop, I'm going to have to ask you to keep an open mind‚Äîa REALLY open mind.  We are going to be dealing with sound itself on its <i>own</i> terms.
            <br><br>
            We're going to slip the bounds of Western 12 tone equal temperament. Heck, we're going to escape <i>all</i> musical systems. We're going to listen to people with zero musical skill bringing their full authentic selves to us through their own musical expression. We're going to let a roll of the dice pick notes on a staff. We're going to let pure randomness fuzz the sine-waves that undulate through the air. And, at the last, we will venture into pure <i>noise</i>.
            <br><br>
            The music in this lesson will rarely be "enjoyable" in the traditional sense. At least at first. This class is about <i>pure experience</i>. About communing with sound and your own sense of hearing in ways you never have before, in ways you could never have conceived of, in ways no person could have.
            <br><br>
            This is music <i>beyond</i> the edge.
            <br><br>
            <img loading="lazy" src="img/universe.jpg" alt="">
            <br><br>
            There is no historical prologue to this lesson. As long as beings have knocked against a tree or a rock and thought, "Hunh, interesting," there has been experimental music. So, instead, we'll need to think conceptually and allow that to guide us. We are dealing with all sound here, anything perceivable. The range of human hearing is roughly 20Hz to 20 kHz‚Äîa rather wide world. So, where to begin?
            <br><br>
            For me, it began with a few preconceptions and a couple of Google searches. I imagined, at the time, that I have a few handful of hours ahead of me. A dozen or so, perhaps spread over an intense weekend. But I soon realized how mistaken I'd been. Three straight weeks of research took over my life. Not just a little here and there, but whole days, 12 hours a day, whirling through unimaginable, incomprehensible soundscapes. The last arrangements to this lesson fell into place almost as I sat down to teach it for the first time. Experimental music seemed so simple‚Äîhow long could it take to research randomness and noise? But I became a person obsessed. I still am. Wonder and fantasy have filled me and brought me to my knees before an endless soundscape the likes of which I had never ever contemplated heretofore. And still and still and still there is so much I could not include. Already I've cut the vast majority of what I wanted to share.
            <br><br>
            But we have a little less than two hours. Not three weeks. So, let's try a different approach.
            <br><br>

            <!-- LONG VERSION -->
            <!-- First, let's think about experimental music in the sense of something carried out with the intention of observing the results, but without full control of what those results may be. In this way we will be examining the work of artists who were skilled musicians, but chose to break away from the expected, as well as artists who were not skilled musicians, but through their unawareness of what they were doing, could have had no preconception of the final product of their imagination. 
            <br><br>
            We'll also stretch this term into what might loosely be called the avant-garde‚Äîmusic that sits beyond classification. Music that was carefully composed (an intended result in sight), but the experience of which can hardly have been predicted.
            <br><br>
            Can we define avant-garde? Ask different people and you'll get slightly different answers on what qualifies as "avant-garde". For the purposes of this lesson, I am calling any music that uses established forms and aims to be "enjoyable" (in the traditional sense), yet pushes past the boundaries of presently codified genres.
            <br><br> -->
            
            Figuring out how to categorize the elements of this lesson was a massive challenge. To keep it short and sweet, ultimately, what we're really doing is examining music that is guided primarily by a spirit of "what if...?"  
            <br><br>
            What if I let an ancient Chinese book guide my machinations? What if I place two speakers exactly this many feet apart and play exactly these opposing frequencies? What if my three daughters‚Äîwho've never touched an instrument‚Äîform a band? What if I throw a lightbulb at a guitar? What if my great talent is love, and I want to express it through my least talent, music?
            <br><br>
            Make sure you don't check out. Re-engage those muscles of patience so long deadened by social media and streaming. Focus, focus, focus on the sound. Warning: There will not always be meaning‚Äîdo not look for it. There is no more meaning to a John Cage piece than there is to the jag turns of a crack in a mirror. Sometimes it will be pure meaning. Daniel Johnston's songs, like, "Love Will Find You In The End" are pure, raw meaning. Some lack talent; some are brilliant, if strange; for some, there is no point in discussing "talent". All along the road there is charm, adventure, and fascination to be had.
            <br><br>
            <img loading="lazy" src="img/universe2b.jpg" alt="">
            <br><br>
            Feel free to laugh. Feeling skeptical is fine. Cringing is understandable. All I ask and all I suggest is that you don't turn off. Stay curious.
            <br><br>
            Finally, I leave you with my ever-repeating exhortation to re-visit this music. This request is both more essential and more difficult than it has been with previous lessons. It is more essential because the only way to grasp the importance and interest of most of these pieces is through complete repeated listenings. What on first listen is a mere jumble of nonsense slowly reveals itself to you over time.  It's also more essential because while a hip-hop, electronic, or country song has melodic lines that burrow into your subconscious, the pieces in this experimental class rarely do (exceptions being the Outsider music and avant-garde music sections). Finally, much of this music (especially the "noise" section) requires you to be able to hear the recording in exceptionally high fidelity in order to get the real point of it all. And, frankly, the nuanced textures just can't be transmitted well over Zoom. Som would even say the only way to really "get" noise is to go to a live performance and cut out the digital middleman altogether.
            <br><br>
            And, of course, for all the reasons that it is so imperative to revisit this music, it is also hard to recommend you do so. I know it's not necessarily "easy" to return to a lot of this stuff. How many times can you listen to a synth wheeze out of tune, or a pane of glass shatter, or a grown man crawl on the ground, screaming, while all but fellating a microphone?  Well, I don't know the answer to that. But I encourage you to find out.

            <div class="details">Perhaps this seems a bit primitive and strange. But truly the modern sense of "noise music", and in some sense "experimental music", begins with Russolo (and finds its more musical foothold with Shoenberg). So, it seems to me important, then, to give him a voice, a chance to explain himself at length, so as to lay the groundwork to come.</div>
            <p>Noise as a genre is exactly what it sounds like. It's a genre of music that aims to draw your attention to all the things we don't think to listen to. By bringing attention to noise, we recontextualize it as something desirable. Have you ever really sat back and listened to the all the little sounds that make up the big sounds from a backhoe at work? Have you ever thought to tap a box of tea, and listen? Have you ever seen a man shove a microphone all the way to the back of his mouth and scream as hard as he can for twenty minutes straight? Can you imagine what that experience would be? After five minutes? Ten? Nineteen?</p>
            <p>For sure, it's funny to think about. But after you've laughed, put aside the sense of absurdity and draw your attention to all the sounds, the noises. All that part of your daily life you give so little thought to. And, then, maybe laugh again. Sometimes it's pretty darn funny.</p>
            <p>Noise music really began in the early 20th century, pioneered by futurists like Luigi Russolo who wrote what is probably the first manifesto on the topic, <i>L'Arte dei Rumori</i>, or The Art of Noises, which I will be reading an extended exceprt from momentarily.</p>
            <p>The Industrial Revolution brought with it a whole vast new world of strange sounds, and the noise movement sought to comprehend the music of industry through a varity of means. </p>
            <p>For those of you interested in "strange" art, the most well-known noise artist may be John Cage. And you may be pelased to know that I've been playing his most famous work, 4'33" on a loop since the lesson started.</p>
            <p>For those less familiar with the more twisted nooks of the music world, the most famous artist in the arena of noise would probably be Lou Reed. He's more well known for his various work with The Velvet Underground, but his standalone album, <i>Metal Machine Music</i>, gained him almost equal notoriety in a different corner of the music world.</p>
            <p>But for those deep in the know, it's really Russolo who started it all, and his words, over a hudnred eyars old now, written just before the Great War began, still ring true. Let's ring those words out again here.</p>

            <div style="padding-left:20%; padding-right: 20%; font-style: italic;">
                Everyone will recognize that each sound carries with it a tangle of sensations, already well-known and exhausted, which predispose the listener to boredom, in spite of the efforts of all musical innovators. We futurists have all deeply loved and enjoyed the harmonies of the great masters, Beethoven and Wagner have stirred our nerves and hearts for many years. Now we have had enough of them, and we delight much more in combining in our thoughts the noises of trams, of automobile engines, of carriages and brawling crowds, than in bearing again the "Eroica" or the "Pastorale. 
                <br><br>

                <br><br>
                We cannot see the enormous apparatus of forces that the modern orchestra represents without feeling the most profound disillusionment before its paltry acoustical results. Do you know of a more ridiculous sight than that of twenty men striving to redouble the mewling of a violin? Naturally, that statement will make the musicomaniacs scream-and perhaps revive the sleepy atmosphere of the concert halls. Let us go together, like futurists, into one of these hospitals for anemic sounds. There-the first beat brings to your ear the weariness of something heard before, and makes you anticipate the boredom of the beat that follows. So let us drink in, from beat to beat, these few qualities of obvious tedium, always waiting for that extraordinary sensation that never comes. Meanwhile, there is in progress a repugnant medley of monotonous impressions and of the cretinous religious emotion of the Buddha-like listeners, drunk with repeating for the thousandth time their more or less acquired and snobbish ecstasy. Away! Let us leave, since we cannot for long restrain ourselves from the desire to create finally a new musical reality by generously handing out some resounding slaps and stamping with both feet on violins, pianos, contrabasses, and organs. Let us go! 
                <br><br>
                It cannot be objected that noise is only loud and disagreeable to the ear. It seems to me useless to enumerate all the subtle and delicate noises that produce pleasing sensations. 
                <br><br>
                To be convinced of the surprising variety of noises, one need only think of the rumbling of thunder, the whistling of the wind, the roaring of a waterfall, the gurgling of a brook, the rustling of leaves, the trotting of a horse into the distance, the rattling jolt of a cart on the road, and of the full, solemn, and white breath of a city at night. Think of all the noises made by wild and domestic animals, and of all those that a man can make, without either speaking or singing.
                <br><br>
                Let us cross a large modern capital with our ears more sensitive than our eyes. We will delight in distinguishing the eddying of water, of air or gas in metal pipes, the muttering of motors that breathe and pulse with an indisputable animality, the throbbing of valves, the bustle of pistons, the shrieks of mechanical saws, the starting of trams on the tracks, the cracking of whips, the flapping of awnings and flags. We will amuse ourselves by orchestrating together in our imagination the din of rolling shop shutters, the varied hubbub of train stations, iron works, thread mills, printing presses, electrical plants, and subways.

                Nor should the newest noises of modern war be forgotten. Recently, the poet Marinetti, in a letter from the trenches of Adrianopolis, described to me with marvelous free words the orchestra of a great battle:

                We want to glve pitches to these diverse noises, regulating them harmonically and rhythmically. Giving pitch to noises does not mean depriving them of all irregular movements and vibrations of time and intensity but rather assigning a degree or pitch to the strongest and most prominent of these vibrations. Noise differs from sound, in fact, only to the extent that the vibrations that produce it are confused and irregular. Every noise has a pitch, some even a chord, which predominates among the whole of its iregular vibrations. Now, from this predominant characteristic pitch derives the practical possibility of assigning pitches to the noise as a whole. That is, there may be imparted to a given noise not only a single pitch but even a variety of pitches without sacrificing its character, by which I mean the timbre that distinguishes it. Thus, some noises obtained through a rotary motion can offer an entire chromatic scale ascending or descending, if the speed of the motion is increased or decreased.
                <br><br>
                Every manifestation of life is accompanied by noise. Noise is thus familiar to our ear and has the power of immediately recalling life itself. Sound, estranged from life, always musical, something in itself, an occasional not a necessary element, has become for our ear what for the eye is a too familiar sight. Noise instead, arriving confused and irregular from the irregular confusion of life, is never revealed to us entirely and always holds innumerable surprises. We are certain, then, that by selecting, coordinating, and controlling all the noises, we will enrich mankind with a new and unsuspected pleasure of the senses. Although the characteristic of noise is that of reminding us brutally of life, the Art of Noises should not limit itself to an imitative reproduction. It will achieve its greatest emotional power in acoustical enjoyment itsclf, which the inspiration of the artist will know how to draw from the combining of noises.

                <div class="artist">Arnold Shoenberg</div>
                <div class="details">The old joke goes: "Schoenberg walks into a bar and order a gin and tonic, hold the tonic." See, Schoenberg did a naughty thing, the sly old dog: He tried to kill the tonic. That is to say, in any line of traditional Western music there is a note that all the other notes continuously reference and return to. The "tonic" is the centerpoint on which the whole key rests, and without it the musical sense is left adrift. Schoenberg, unlike many of the others in this lesson, was not trying to undo or subvert Western music. Indeed, he was in love with it and wanted to propagate it far into the future. His way of doing this was to make a Romanov of the tonic and install an anarchist in its place, giving a democratic equality to each note in the 12 tones of the Western system. Such a contradiction could hardly work, of course. As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7O_3q-ZttQ" target="#">Gelnn Gould quipped</a>, speaking of Schoenberg's faith in his 12-tone system, "Schoenberg himself once said, 'It vil ensure ze supremacy of German music for ahnahzah hundred yeers.'

                <div class="details">Ligeti was a Hungarian composer who was instrumental in driving the development of the avant-garde in music in the mid-20th century. His work may feel familiar at times‚Äîwhile he never explicitly composed for film, a lot of his work has been absorbed into cinema by directors who were fans of his, such as Kubrick and Scorsese. <br><br> The work we're listening to here is one of his few electronic pieces. The piece was composed using a mix of chance and explicit composition. Ligeti explained: "First I chose types [of noise, or artificial phonemes] with various group-characteristics and various types of internal organization, as: grainy, friable, fibrous, slimy, sticky and compact materials. An investigation of the relative permeability of these characters indicated which could be mixed and which resisted mixture." He then created recordings of these sounds, cut them individually from the taped recording, and grouped them into bins according to their characteristics. He then reached into the bins at random, took out a slice of recording, and taped it together. <br><br>The graphical score we'll be viewing along with the music was created after the fact by a graphic designer with Ligeti's approval. It is designed to guide the listener towards a "unique and appealing aesthetic."</div>

                <div class="artist">John Cage</div>
                <div class="details">How do you introduce a person like John Cage? It could be argued that John Cage is the most influential person in experimental music, perhaps in modern music altogether. His most famous work is probably 3'44", a piece performed at the piano where the pianist does absolutely nothing for exactly three minutes and forty-four seconds. It is not, as is often assumed, an investigation of silence, but rather a revelation that there is no such thing as silence. If you are truly listening during a performance of 3'44", even if you are all alone in a perfectly insulated room, you will hear your own blood. The silence of 3'44" is truly an exploration of the omnipresence of sound. 
                <br><br>
                He's also well-remembered for using the <i>I Ching</i>, an ancient Chinese text, to create random patterns for his music, either in the arrangement of parts, or in the adjustments to the instruments, or some combination. <br><br>Today's first selection is one he performed in front of the whole country on "I've Got a Secret." It's called Water Walk. And, while it may seem strange and chaotic, it actually has a very specific set of instructions noted down in a textual and graphical score that you can view <a href="https://www.robertspahr.com/links/data/waterwalkscore.pdf">here</a>.
                <br><br>
                I've also included one of his more "traditional" (if it can be called that, even with the scare quotes around it) piano pieces. The screws wound between the wires would have been placed at random. Whether the pianist followed Cage's randomization instructions, or reproduced his own randomized result, I don't know.
                <br><br>
                <img loading="lazy" src="img/Cage-preparing-piano-1-cropped.jpg" alt="">
                <br><br>
                What I do know is that John Cage is perhaps the best composer to learn and discuss the term <i>aleatoric</i>. It's a word I imagine few are familiar with, but it informs much of experimental music, and should be elaborated on before we continue much further.
                <br>
                <p>Aleatoric music is a mid-ground between pure chance and pure composition. Parts of it are left to chance, though there are some limits to how things may unfold. </p>
                <p>We can find this type of music even in Mozart's time and the <i>Musikalisches W√ºrfelspiel</i>, or "musical dice game." There would be a sequence of measures of music, the order of which would be determined at the performance by the roll of dice.</p>
                <p>John Cage's works are a more modern example of this. Famously, in some of his works, he would use the <i>I Ching</i> to determine a variety of features of his composition. But, still, there was always some limit. Perhaps the I Ching would determine the placement of a screw in the wires of a piano, but it would always be a piano used.</p>
                <p>There were also the graphical scores used by many experimental composers in the mid-20th century. We'll see some examples of these later on, but to sum up the idea, traditional musical notation is done away with and some sort of drawing is meant to guide the player in their performance, rather than giving specific isntructions.</p>
                <p>As a twist, when the music is pre-recorded, as in the way of much electronic music, the score becomes a Virgil to the the listener, guiding them into the depths of the composer's madness, however many layers deep it may go.</p>
                <p>The aleatoric bends and twists the ideas of composer, performer, and listener.</p>
                <p>Another interesting example of the aleatoric‚Äîand one which most of us have experienced at some point‚Äîis music in games. In this we find the performer unaware of their performance. As one moves through the world of a game, the music needs to adjust to player input and the condition of the gameplay. In some versions of Tetris, for example, as your stack of blocks gets closer to the danger zone, the speed of the music picks up. In adventure games, as you move from area to area, the music will change to express the nature of your new surroundings. All of this needs to feel like a single uninterrupted experience, yet it is controlled unconsciously all along by the player.</p>
                <p>Later, we'll find the Fluxus movement, which puts emphasis on the performance itself, and less on the composition. In fact, even the noise which we'll discover later is built on an aleatoric approach to music. In most cases, there is a chaos (one cannot know how a pane of glass will break), but also a control (one knows they will break a pane of glass).</p>
                <p>John Cage may not have been the inventor of this approach, but he is perhaps the greatest figurehead of it.</p>

No, Partch dug deep into the world of sound and crafted a music that was uniquely his. <br><br>For starters, Partch decided to chop up the 12 tone system so familiar to Western musicians and listeners, refining it into a mathematically constructed, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwLeCO2w9H4" target="#">43 microtone system</a> that he used for his music. However, he was perhaps most instantly recognizable for the incredible array of instruments he created himself. Most easily notable on stage are bamboo marimbas, chromelodeons (organs modified to use his 43-tone system), the cloud-chamber bowls (a series of Pyrex bowls suspended on strings from a bar), and the gourd tree (12 bells bolted to a eucalyptus tree).  There are more‚Äîmany more‚Äîbut these are perhaps the most immediately noticable.</div>

                <div class="details">
                Terry Riley's work sought to disrupt the listeners' conception of time, to fizzle out one's intution for temporal awareness, like an aural hallucinogenic.  <a href="https://teropa.info/blog/2017/01/23/terry-rileys-in-c.html" target="#">In C is perhaps Riley's more well known work</a>, and one of the very first minimalist works ever composed. Let's read <a href="http://musictheoryprof.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/in-C.pdf" target="#">his instructions</a> to the players.
                </div>
                <hr class="outer">
                <br>
                <div style="padding-left:20%; padding-right: 20%; font-style: italic;">
                "All performers play from the same page of 53 melodic patterns played in sequence. Any number of any kind of instruments can play. A group of about 35 is desired if possible but smaller or larger groups will work. If vocalist(s) join in they can use any vowel and consonant sounds they like.
                <br><br>
                Patterns are to be played consecutively with each performer having the freedom to determine how many times he or she will repeat each pattern before moving on to the next. There is no fixed rule as to the number of repetitions a pattern may have, however, since performances normally average between 45 minutes and an hour and a half, it can be assumed that one would repeat each pattern from somewhere between 45 seconds and a minute and a half or longer.
                <br><br>
                It is very important that performers listen very carefully to one another and this means occasionally to drop out and listen. As an ensemble, it is very desirable to play very softly as well as very loudly and to try to diminuendo and crescendo together.
                <br><br>
                Each pattern can be played in unison or canonically in any alignment with itself or with its neighboring patterns. One of the joys of IN C is the interaction of the players in polyrhythmic combinations that spontaneously arise between patterns. Some quite fantastic shapes will arise and disintegrate as the group moves through the piece when it is properly played.
                <br><br>
                It is important not to hurry from pattern to pattern but to stay on a pattern long enough to interlock with other patterns being played. As the performance progresses, performers should stay within 2 or 3 patterns of each other. It is important not to race too far ahead or to lag too far behind.
                <br><br>
                ...
                <br><br>
                The tempo is left to the discretion of the performers, obviously not too slow, but not faster than performers can comfortably play.
                <br><br>
                ...
                <br><br>
                IN C is ended in this way: when each performer arrives at figure #53, he or she stays on it until the entire ensemble has arrived there. The group then makes a large crescendo and diminuendo a few times and each player drops out as he or she wishes." <br><br>

            <div class="info">
                <div class="artist">Krzysztof Penderecki</div>
                <div class="details">The <i>Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima</i> was not, in fact, originally written with the victims in mind. Originally, the piece was titled‚Äîwith a nod towards John Cage‚Äî8'37".  It was after Penderecki, the Polish composer of the piece, sat down to hear the first live performance that he was inspired to rename the work in honor of the aforementioned victims.</div>
                <div style="padding-left:20%; padding-right: 20%; font-style: italic;">
                    This piece may suggest many images to a listener‚Äîbuzzing insects, shrieking sirens, even a bomb exploding. The musical encyclopedist Nicolas Slonimsky felt that the work‚Äôs conclusion was ‚Äúa massive tonal cloud of gray matter, encompassing two octavefuls of icositetraphonic harmony‚Äù‚Äîicositetraphonic denoting the division of an octave into twenty-four steps. It is nonetheless worth underscoring that Penderecki approached it on strictly musical terms. ‚ÄúFirst of all,‚Äù he wrote, ‚ÄúI was a string player. I was at that time still playing and working in the Warsaw Experimental Electronic Music Studio, experimenting with the violin and electronic instruments. . . . I think the electronic studio helped me at that time in experimenting with all those clusters you find. . . .‚Äù By clusters, he was referring to a practice established in new-music circles decades before‚Äîsonorities in which all the notes between high and low end-points are sounded at once. Traditionally, this was an agglomeration of chromatic half-tones, but in the Threnody, Penderecki‚Äôs clusters also encompass quarter-tones, with each player within a defined instrumental group playing a different pitch. This composition may sound to some listeners like a piece of electronic music transcribed for acoustic instruments. In fact, it was an acoustic conception from the outset, though emerging from a mind well acquainted with electronic sound.

                    The Threnody is scored for 52 strings, with each musician playing an individual line... All of the players employ extended techniques that go far beyond the normal string vocabulary of bowing or, for a special effect, plucking (pizzicato). The bows strike many places on the strings‚Äîalong the fingerboard, on or near the bridge, between the bridge and the tailpiece, and so on. The musicians employ wide variations of vibrato and tremolo, sometimes changing the flutter of a note substantially as it is sustained, often connecting notes with seamless glissandos. They do these things at extremes of volume. They strike the body of their instruments with their bows or their fingers. ‚ÄúIn my Threnody of 1960, the string instruments sound like percussion,‚Äù observed Penderecki in his 1997 interview. ‚ÄúToday, such a solution is nothing new.‚Äù

                    Details of his Threnody did indeed become much imitated. As part of his composition, Penderecki invented various symbols to signify the effects he envisioned; these became standard in new music graphic notation, just as the sounds themselves became adopted by other composers who worked at the outer limits of acoustic possibilities. No live performance of the Threnody can be replicated exactly; although the piece is written out in careful detail, Penderecki allows the musicians some leeway in interpreting the score, the aleatoric aspects extending even to letting the players decide in what order they may play certain groupings of notes. There are no bar-lines in the score; instead, the duration of pitches or gestures is indicated by timings, in seconds. The piece can seem to stand on the brink of chaos at many moments, yet the composer keeps it under attentive control much as composers have always done.

                <div class="details">While Mauricio Kagel worked in traditional, classical music forms, he also stepped wildly outside them as well. His playful, absurdist compositions would give instructions to performers, directing not just their hands and breath, but also their expressions and gait. Entrances were as important as the moment of playing. In the piece I've selected today, we can listen as two men control a whole orchestra of instruments with a mix of sinceretiy and silliness.</div>

            <div class="info">
                <div class="artist">Maryanne Amacher</div>
                <div class="details">She was a student of Stockhausen, and yet was so out-there in her own approach to music, that even he (the man who composed a piece for <i>helicopters</i>) said she was an "alien." Hopefully that gives you a decent picture the sort of mad genius we're dealing with here.
                <br><br>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVvOemu-ZTk" target="#">She built her music</a> by working with what she termed, "perceptual geography", aka sonic spatialization. This is basically the human, low-level equivalent of echolocation, the ability to hear a sound and place it properly in 3D space in your mind. So, she would use a large space, and then carefully arrange speakers around it‚Äîone foot this direction, spin it around, shift it left a few inches‚Äî, perhaps moving objects in the way of the sound, or even lugging the speakers into a separate room to be muffled. As you moved through the space she had adorned with sound, everything aural shifted according to her precise spatial desires.
                <br><br>
                But this alone was not enough envelope-pushing for her. It is one thing to accurately identify the direction of a sound, and even to note the way objects distort it. It's another to begin to question your sense of sound and direction, for the sounds in the speakers to cause <i>you</i> to emit noises within your own mind, separate from the outer world.
                <br><br>
                Amacher engaged an effect known as the Otoacoustic Emission.  This is where the cochlea in the ears actually create their own sound caused by "combination tones". Combination tones are a psycho-acoustic phenomenon that occur when listening to two different frequencies. Essentially, your ear hears the sum and difference of the two input frequencies. So, if one speaker plays a 1300Hz note and another plays a 1100Hz note, your ears will then produce a 200Hz and 2400Hz tone on their own.

                It's not too easy to experience this effect, however. You need very loud speakers, and you need to do it without headphones.

                Personally, I find Amacher to be one of the most fascinating artists in this lesson. At the same time, her work is the most inaccessible. While others have worked to reproduce her efforts, it seems to me that one could only have truly expreienced her vision when she was alive and had personally arranged her devices. Her music was a trans-personal experience‚Äîin one way a deeply individual expression of her own sensibilities, and also a singular experience within the listener's self. Her work was so disruptive, it dismantled a person's own sense of perceptual geography. Many artists can break us down emotionally, or intellectually, but how many can wholly re-write our relationship with reality? Well, at least one. Maryanne Amacher.

                <div class="details">Fun fact: Oliveros was a member of the faculty at UC San Diego. In reaction to the horrors of the world in the late 60s, she retreated within and began to develop her meditative relationship with sound. According to a review of her work in the New Yorker, "She started singing and playing long, extended drones on her accordion, spending nearly a year on a single note, an A." From there she expanded, developing her relationship with sound and mediation, writing out instructions that were one part zen, one part music. She built up the concept of "sonic awareness," or the ability to focus one's attention directly on the musicality of environmental sound. In this way, she was one of the true exponents of noise.</div>

I was embarrassed and glanced towards the Roshi to see how he was taking it. The expression on his face was absolutely beatific."

            <p style="padding-left:20%; padding-right: 20%;">Free Jazz can be considered an umbrella term that encompases Free Jazz proper, Free Improvisation, and avant-garde Jazz. The music here began around the 60s and aims to break free of Jazz conventions. Destroy the meter; obliterate the tonic; flush the harmonies; chrush the chords. As more conventions are destroyed, so more yet must be destroyed; as new conventions arise, so must they too be brought asunder.</p>

                <div class="quote">"After nearly thirty-five years, it is still impossible to speak of Ascension without a word of caution. It is the single most vexatious work in jazz history. So, a word of caution: It can't hurt you. In fact, contrary to its reputation as the apogee in '60s free-jazz rants, the piece goes down as smooth as bourbon, at least after you've heard it a few times and can no longer be intimidated by its shock tactics... Ascension is based on a minor triad and a couple of ground chords for the ensemble passages‚Äîthat's it. The format consists of alternating solos and ensemble passages, the latter mandated to climax as crescendos in which the wind instruments freely bellow. At first blush, it might be described as a terrible din periodically interrupted so that a soloist can bellow in peace... Coming to the end of the music's long night, you may blink at the silence in stunned relief and inscrutable rapture. Or you may not. In any case, return visits to Ascension reveal it as decreasingly monolithic. Fake notes‚Äîcackles and hollers and shrieks and squawks‚Äîare still notes, and fortuitous harmonies and melodies, forged in the cauldron of chance, will on repeated exposure seem as preordained as composed music."

Though the fury is frightening, dangerous, it achieves absolute certainty through being, musically, absolutely contained... Ayler seemingly rarely hears one note at a time‚Äîas if it were useless ever to consider the particles of a thing. He seems to want to scan all notes at all times and in this way speak to an expanded consciousness. And the consistency in this outpouring is a reference point from which his music takes shape... Ayler's music, as well as most avant-garde music, is, at best, difficult to listen to. It is nevertheless a very direct statement, the physical manifestation of a spiritual or mystical ritual. Its logic is the logic of human flesh in the sphere of the spirit. Could it be that ritual is more accessible to some listeners than it is to others?"

Besides a massive catalog of records in Jazz, noise, drone, and more, he's also composed soundtracks for some seriously notable Japanese TV shows (Amachan and Idaten, to name two‚Äîwhich I definitely recommend) and films. <br><br>Still, his music grabbed my attention more than all the rest. He's as driven by improvisation and randomness and an intrigue for noise as the rest, but there is something, perhaps a hyper-awareness, that makes even his most chaotic sounds grip you.</div>

The sound of a truck at fifty miles per hour. Static between the stations. Rain. We want to capture and control these sounds, to use them not as sound effects but as musical instruments. Every film studio has a library of "sound effects" recorded on film. With a film phonograph it is now possible to control the amplitude and frequency of any one of these sounds and to give to it rhythms within or beyond the reach of the imagination. Given four film phonographs, we can compose and perform a quartet for explosive motor, wind, heartbeat, and landslide."

Who had and still have basically, no music, be it verbal or instrumental to listen to. One of the peripheral effects typically distorted was what was to be known as heavy metal rock. In Reality it was of course diffuse, obtuse, weak, boring and ultimately an embarrassment. This record is not for parties/dancing/background romance. This is what I ment by "real" rock, about "real" things. No one I know has listened to it all the way through including myself. It is not meant to be. Start any place you like. Symmetry, mathematical precision, obsessive and detailed accuracy and the vast advantage one has over "modern electronic composers." They, with neither sense of time, melody or emotion, manipulated or no. It's for a certain time and place of mind. It is the only recorded work I know of seriously done as well as possible as a gift, if one could call it that, from a part of certain head to a few others. Most of you won't like this and I don't blame you at all. It's not meant for you. At the very least I made it so I had something to listen to. Certainly Misunderstood: Power to Consume (how Bathetic): an idea done respectfully, intelligently, sympathetically and graciously, always with concentration on the first and formost goal.

The agreement one makes with "speed". A specific acknowlegment. A to say the least, very limited market. Rock n Roll Animal makes this possible, funnily enough. The misrepresentation succeeds to the point of making possible the appearance of the progenitor. For those for whom the needle is no more than a toothbrush. Professionals, no sniffers please, don't confuse superiority (no competition) with violence, power or the iustifications. The Tacit speed agreement with Self. We did not start World War I, II or III.

                <div class="details">It's hard to overstate how important Merzbow has been to noise music. But it's perhaps even more difficult to eplain how, or why. And perhaps impossible to describe why you'd want to listen to him. <br><br>
                It certainly doesn't help that he has an absolutely gargantuan discography, and yet his most well-known work in the West (due to it being his first album released in the West) is <i>Pulse Demon</i>, a <i>Metal Machine Music</i>-like album that's a wall of distortion. Is Pulse Demon interesting? Sure, but it's hardly what I'd call an "entry point" for his music. <br><br>
                Reddit user /u/jdrantula (01/07/2019) suggests even that seeing Merzbow live is the only true way to get a feel for the music: "I was in a similar boat, but i just caught him live for the first time last year and was completely blow away! All the layers were evident with the massive, state-of-the-art soundsystem. His mastery of texture and attention to structure was all in there." <br><br>
                Another user suggests, "its...a soundtrack to a wandering mind....  I see it almost as a sort of Rorschach test, if that makes any sense. free association might be a better way to put it. the more you listen to an album, youll definitely find hidden stuff because you are coming to it with a different mindset everytime."
                <br><br>
                I'm going to include a few different selections here, but we'll be listening to a bit of an album titled 2R0I2P0, which is a collaboration between Merzbow and the experimental artist Boris. This album actually <i>is</i> listenable. It's downright wonderful. Boris creates a soothing, minimalist, musical song, and Merzbow layers soft hints of chaos over it, creating a perfectly meditative experience.

                <div class="artist">Pharmakon (Margaret Chardiet)</div>
                <div class="quote">Throughout her work as Pharmakon, Margaret Chardiet stages existential conflicts‚Äîbetween the self and the body that houses it, between the individual and the unknowable other‚Äîby setting her own voice in opposition to brambly, industrial electronics. She cries out against nightmares of her own making as if in the grips of pain or panic
                    <br>...<br>
                Between lurches of electronic noise, Chardiet squeals and rasps and growls, her voice lacerated by the barbed-wire sieve of effects. These songs center her prowess as an industrial vocalist, someone who can transmute the chronic trauma of survival under capitalism into an appropriately scathing outburst. But somewhere between the hypnotic throb of ‚ÄúSpit It Out‚Äù and the military clip of ‚ÄúSelf-Regulating System‚Äôs percussion, Chardiet‚Äôs chaos paradoxically prompts a deepening sense of calm. It‚Äôs as if, by giving voice to the mesh of self-loathing strangling so many of our brains, she can momentarily dislodge it.

                <div class="details">These guys rock. I don't know how else to put it. Pedestrian Deposit is the work of Jonathan Borges and Shannon Kennedy, a couple, who put their whole bodies into the music. Their work crosses back and forth between pure noise and music with effortlessness, all of it drawn from a powerful well of creativity. With these two, it seems everything is deliberate and highly thought out. <br><br>The studio albums are interesting, but I've found the most fascinating aspect of them to be their live performances.</div>
                <br><br>
                <div class="quote">"They don‚Äôt perform often, which makes sense considering how draining their live shows can be. At their most recent local gig, held nearly a year ago at the downtown DIY space Handbag Factory, Borges blasted the audience with squealing power electronics while Kennedy turned herself into a human stringed instrument, scraping a bow across an amplified metal wire, with one end fastened to a collar around her neck and the other coiled tightly around her arm.
                    <br><br>
                The performance was spellbinding. It was also painful, leaving bloody lacerations on Kennedy‚Äôs skin and pushing her muscles to the limit.
                <br><br>
                'Think about the amount of tension that it takes for the ‚ÄòA‚Äô string on a cello to make that sound,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm physically being the tuning peg that is creating that tension with those instruments. It takes a lot of strength to do that, and for me, part of the excitement is, am I gonna have the strength to do this tonight?'"

            <h2>Outsider Music</h2>
            <p style="padding-left:20%; padding-right: 20%;">Outsider music is not a genre. It's a classification. And, perhaps, some would consider it an unfair classification. But, essentially, it's music from people who, for lack of a better way to put it, can't make music. At least, they can't seem to make music the way your average Top-40s listener would appreciate. These artists usually have little-to-no music training. They often suffer from disabilities. But what they all have is art. Even the worst of so-called outsider music has charm. And some of it is truely excellent, if unconventional. And much of it‚Äîsurprisingly, some of the "worst" of it‚Äîhas been massively influential to insiders.</p>

Lo, a marriage to a blonde woman, and behold three daughters born to the happy couple. It was only natural that all must be completed as was foretold. No matter than the girls couldn't sing and didn't know how to play any instruments. A pox on your doubts! Behold The Shaggs!</div>

                <div class="details">Daniel Johnston spent his whole life struggling with mental illness, moving in and out of mental facilities during his youth, and propped up on copious medication throughout the rest of his time. He didn't have formal training, and he certainly didn't have the best tools. But armed with a (very) cheap guitar, a children's electric organ, and a mistuned piano, he belted out his heart‚Äîhis anguish and his fantasies‚Äîinto a low-quality, handheld cassette recorder. <br><br>His raw, yet powerful albums made their way into the world and built up a notoriety around them, and subsequently a following. Eventually he got picked up by a record company. What's remarkable about the albums that come out in this period is that with the better instruments and mics and mixers, you can confirm what you could already intuit: he had a natural musical talent. And all those thousands of dollars of equiptment can't dull the rawness of his music. <br><br>Unironically, I find his lyrics and vocalization to be some of the best. He reminds me of Dylan, without the self-consciousness. Johnston may be my favorite discovery from researching this lesson, and I hope he'll become one of your favorites as well.</div>

                <div class="details">Tiny Tim might be the most "insider" of these outsider artists. Irwin Chusid explains, in his book <i>Songs in the Key of Z</i>: "He embodies the compulsion to create against astronomical odds. He could never quit. He had a destiny, which he would fulfill to the grave, regardless of public indifference, lack of money, or changing musical fashions. He demonstrated how far a genuine outsider musician could go without a manufactured makeover. No one else in this [lesson] appeared on The Tonight Show. Tiny Tim made over 20 appearances. He also guested on the Andy Williams, Merv Griffin, and Red Skelton TV shows. He dueted with Bing Crosby. Played the Royal Albert Hall. Spent the night at Bob Dylan‚Äôs house. Performed on a Beatles album. And in true outsider form, accomplished it all without modifying his style one iota‚Äîthat is, without compromise." <br><br>Tiny Tim of the quivering falsetto and ubiquitous ukelele, spent years beyond even the bottom of the New York music scene, playing old Vaudeville and Tin Pan Alley hits in a basement freak show in old Times Square. He languished for nearly twenty years before being discovered, and from there his star rose and crashed and rose again, ricocheting like the vibrato in his songs.</div>

No one knows if Shooby Taylor is still living or not; he wasn‚Äôt ever a professional musician, he just made these remarkable recordings. <br><br> The tape I got was taken from a Dutch radio show, when a DJ from Hoboken aired the tapes when visiting Holland. When I first heard it I laughed all the way through, but now I can‚Äôt stop listening to it.

This bedlam-prone prairie dawg earned notoriety for his uninhibited howling and utter vocal abandon, oblivious to such quaint notions as euphony, rhythm, and restraint. His oral artistry consists of the astonishing number of ways he can emit musical sounds‚Äîwithout actually singing. Besides the rebel yell, the Commanche war whoop, and hog hollerin‚Äô, he‚Äôs mastered elephant cries, birdcalls, frog croaks, and a menagerie of jungle squawks. The man wails, cackles, and belches; he grunts, growls, and taunts.

                <div class="details">Composed on a piano by a man who didn't know the first thing about how to play and translated into something approximating a song by a team of actually talented musicians (struggling always against the Captain's overbearing micro-management and his demands for literally-impossible-to-play notes), Captain Beefheart's music, particularly off his first album, Trout Mask Replica, is utterly original. There <i>are</i> identifiable time signatures, contrary to popular belief, but they're nearly unintelligible, two guitars and a bass each playing a different tempo, and each playing in key signatures opposed to each other, while shifting in and out of those keys at shocking intervals. All of this is intentional. <br><br> The entire album was written in a single eight-hour session, then rehearsed for a whole year before being recorded in a single set of just a handful of hours. <br><br>Without the Captain and his crew, we wouldn't have The Clash, Sex Pistols, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, or many others who've claimed his work as direct inspiration. </div>
