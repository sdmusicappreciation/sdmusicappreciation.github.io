                <p>In 1750, Thomas Kean and Walter Murray opened one of the first theatres in New York City on Nassau Street. It was large enough to hold 280 patrons. Patrons flocked newly established theaters to see such ballad operas as John Gay's The Beggar's Opera and Shakespearean plays like The Merchant of Venice. </p>

                <p>Early theater in New York was separated according to class. Opera was attended by the wealthy. Melodramas and Minstrel shows were popular among the middle class. The working class went to more affordable variety shows. Musicals weren't performed until the mid 19th century. Prior to this, performances were non-musical acts. Considered the first modern musical, The Black Crook came out in 1866 and contained both original music and choreographed dance. It was a little less than six hours long. Comic Operas by Gilbert and Sullivan were also extremely popular during that time.</p>

                <p>Popular music met big business with big results. In Tin Pan Alley (28th Street between Broadway and Fifth Avenue in New York City) numerous music publishing houses poured forth popular songs each year. The musical theater and the private parlor rang with the sounds of ragtime, romantic ballads, and comedy songs.</p>
                <p>Famous composers we often associate with Broadway - Cole Porter, Rodgers and Hart, George Gershwin, etc. - began composing music for Broadway shows during the "raging" 1920's. </p>

                    <p>Known prior to WWI as "the man who owned Broadway", Cohan wrote light comedic musical dramas during the first two decades of the 20th century. Cohan enjoyed his first musical hit with ‚ÄúLittle Johnny Jones‚Äù in 1904. It featured songs such as "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandee" and "Give my regards to Broadway." </p>
                    <p>n 1917, when America entered World War I, Cohan was inspired to compose ‚ÄúOver There,‚Äù the song that would become his greatest hit. Americans coast to coast listened to the recording made by popular singer Nora Bayes. Twenty-five years later, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt awarded Cohan the Congressional Medal of Honor for the patriotic spirit expressed in this war song. </p>

                    <p>By 1918 he had shown enough promise to be hired by Harms, Inc., as a songwriter at a weekly salary. His first big success was in 1919 with the song ‚ÄúSwanee‚Äù (words by Irving Caesar), introduced by Al Jolson in ‚ÄúSinbad.‚Äù In the same year he composed his first complete score, for the successful musical ‚ÄúLa, La, Lucille.‚Äù</p>

                    <h2>Rogers and Hammerstein</h2>
                    <p>The first musical written by Rogers and Hammerstein, Oklahoma!, revived Broadway after the depression. First performed in 1943, It paved the way for Broadway's golden years. Carousel was adapted for Broadway soon after in 1945.  Richard Rodgers wrote in his autobiography, ‚ÄúOne of the most frequent questions I am asked is: ‚ÄòWhat is your favorite of all your musicals?‚Äô My answer is Carousel. Oscar never wrote more meaningful or more moving lyrics, and to me, my score is more satisfying that any I‚Äôve ever written.‚Äù</p>

                    <h2>Les Mis√©rables</h2>
                    <p>The sung-through musical was originally written in French by Claude-Michel Sch√∂nberg, Alain Boubil and Jean-Marc Natel and staged in 1980 as a rock opera. After a short 105 performance run in Paris, Cameron Mackintosh (producer of Cats) heard the soundtrack and decided to produce an English-language version for a British audience. Working with the Royal Shakespeare Company, Mackintosh‚Äôs Mis√©rables opened in 1985 with new lyrics by Herbert Kretzmer and James Fenton. It would reach Broadway in 1987. The legendary show about ex-convict Jean Valjean and his rival, policeman Javert, received mixed reviews from critics but blew audiences away.</p>
                    <p>One early review: The Observer‚Äôs Michael Ratcliffe dismissed the show as ‚Äúa witless and synthetic entertainment.‚Äù</p>
                    <p>Les Miserables celebrated its 10th anniversary with a gala concert at the Royal Albert Hall, London. The concert starred the original Jean Valjean, Colm Wilkinson. The finale featured 17 different Jean Valjeans from around the world singing in different languages.</p>

                    <p>The music for Fiddler was composed by Jerrold Lewis "Jerry" Bock with the help of lyricist Sheldon Harnick.</p>

                        <p>‚ÄúSheldon and I, we‚Äôd become somewhat familiar with the book, we‚Äôd separate and I would guess as to what kind of music in terms of ambience, period, character, and so forth. So I would send Sheldon a half a dozen melodic guesses,‚Äù says Bock.</p>
                        <p>‚ÄúI always looked forward to these tapes that Jerry would send,‚Äù Harnick continues. ‚ÄúOn each tape, one or two of them would coincide with ideas I had for lyrics.‚Äù What Bock tells ‚ÄúShel‚Äù in his recorded introduction on his melodic demo of ‚ÄúIf I Were a Rich Man‚Äù is priceless. (You‚Äôll have to watch to hear it.)</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>The original 1964 Broadway production had the first musical theatre run in history to surpass 3,000 performances. Fiddler held the record for the longest-running Broadway musical for almost 10 years until it was surrpassed by Grease.</p>

                <p>Broadway hosts many of the best actors from all over the world. Various Award ceremonies were established to recognize their efforts. The Tony Awards, established in 1947, highlight those who invested their hearts and souls into theater. More specific to Broadway, the Drama Desk Awards are given to Broadway and off-Broadway productions.</p>

                    <p>The first Tony Awards was originally called  Antoinette Perry Awards for Excellence in Theatre. The name of the award was changed when Brok Pemberton handed out an award and called it a ‚ÄúTony‚Äù ‚Äì which was Antoinette‚Äôs nickname.  However, no actor legally named Tony has ever won a Tony.</p>
                    <p>For the first 2 years, the winners were not given statues as awards but pocket sized awards along with scrolls. The men were given cigarette lighters and the women were given a make up compact.</p>
                    <p>In 1947, you could buy a ticket to the Tonys for just $7. The success of the event shot up the prices to $10 in 1948. Today, it costs a whopping $2990 to purchase a ticket to the Tonys.</p>

                    <li>The doors to the theater were chained shut and under guard four days before opening night.</li>
                    <li>Actors could not appear on any unsanctioned stage (actors' union)</li>
                    <li>They would have to pay the musicians their full rate instead of the reduced FTP rate, as well as back pay for previous rehearsals, and they would also have to hire more musicians to comply with standard Broadway contracts. (musicians' union)</li>
                    <li>The actors were unable to access any of their costumes, props, or set pieces.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Solution: The audience was dragged to a different theater, the actors perform while hidden amongst said audience, and the composer himself accompanied on piano.</p>

The most controversial element in the play was a brief nude scene with the entire cast that ended the first act.</p>

Many other plays are measured on a ‚Äúbadness‚Äù scale by comparing it to this one. It joins others that did not make it past opening night including: Glory Days, Brothers, and Frankenstein the Musical</p>

                    <p>Amongst the many Broadway Theatres that are believed to be haunted, the Palace Theatre is said to have almost 100 spirits are supposedly stalking the theatre. The most freuqent phantom is Judy Garland who performed in the theatre in the 1950s. Many people have seen her appear near the door in the orchestra pit. The other common visitor is Louis Bossalina, an acrobat who was gravely injured during a high-wire act in 1935 when the theatre was a vaudeville house.</p>
