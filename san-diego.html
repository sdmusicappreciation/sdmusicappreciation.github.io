                        </header>
                        <div class="info--text">
                            <p>Frank Zappa moved to SD from Baltimore at the age of 13. He attended Grossmont and Mission Bay Highschool.</p>
                            <p>Zappa joined his first band, The Ramblers,  freshman year of high school. He began his musical journey as a drummer, and not a particularly good one.  Zappa used pots and pans for drums at rehearsals, since he didn‚Äôt actually acquire a drum kit until the w eek before the gig. He played his first show at the Uptown Hall at40th & Meade, after which the band split the seven dollar take between them. Having been chastised for being too splashy with his cymbals, being a little shaky with the rhythm, and managing to forget to bring drum sticks to his first gig, it wasn‚Äôt long before the Ramblers replaced him.</p>
                            <p>
                                Unfortunately, Zappa never graduated from Mission Bay. This was due to a fondness for explosives, which he demonstrated by setting off a mixture of rocket fuel and stink powder during a Parent Open House. The Zappa family proceeded to relocate to Lancaster after his expulsion.

                            <p>Daniel Jackson was a saxophonist, pianist, composer, and music teacher. Inspired to play sax at a young age (by Harold Land who played in a band with his  elder brother, Fred,  and who later played with the Clifford Brown Quartet), Jackson's mother paid for his lessons on a maid's wage. When she could no longer afford those, Jackson made a deal with his teacher, agreeing to mow his lawn in exchange for lessons.</p>
                            <p>After graduating, Jackson joined the navy, where he met and played with among others Wes Montgomery.</p>

I would write music for him because he couldn‚Äôt read or write [music]. He‚Äôd come up with some tune and he‚Äôd say, ‚ÄòHey, man, can you write some notes down for me?‚Äô And I‚Äôd do that.‚Äù </p>

                            <p>Jackson returned to SD and went on to play with and teach those that would later become the greats: bassists Bob Magnusson and Mark Dresser, trumpeter Gilbert Castellanos, pianist Mike Wofford, sax symbol Charles McPherson, flutist Holly Hofmann, and pianist-singer A.J. Croce.</p>
                            <p>In January 2010, San Diego City Councilwoman Donna Frye officially declared the week of January 24 to be Daniel Jackson Week. At the time Jackson was on Sabbatical, and Frye, a long time fan, wanted to make sure that his music was always celebrated.</p>

                            <p>Yes, I have my own band.  I moved to San Diego in 1980.  Since 2008, my band has played every Sunday morning at the Big Kitchen (my sister's restaurant). Hopefully, after the epidemic, we will continue to serenade the neighborhood.  The band has had many members throughout the years.  Right now it consists of Me on Alto sax, Floyd Fronius (my husband) on violin, Armand Frigon on guitar, Gedeon Deak on bass and Ray Conseur on drums.  We make beautiful music together!!!</p>
